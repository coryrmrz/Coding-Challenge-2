//Task 1: Calculate the Tip

let bill = 125; // Amount of bill
const tip = bill >= 100 ? bill * 0.2 : bill * 0.15; // If bill is higher than 100, then 20% tip, if not then 15% tip

console.log(`Bill is the amount of $${bill}, the tip is the amount of $${tip}, the total amount is $${bill + tip}`); //Bill total explained
